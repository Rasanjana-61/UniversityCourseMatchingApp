# Backend deployment

The mobile app calls `https://abc-self-psi.vercel.app/api`. Its announcements
use `GET` and `POST /api/notifications`, plus `PUT` and `DELETE
/api/notifications/:id`. These routes are registered in `index.js` before the
404 handler. Personal inbox routes use `/api/student-notifications`.

If the hosted API returns `Route not found: /api/notifications` while
`/api/health` works, check that the hosted project deploys this backend's latest
source. Changing the mobile app URL path or rebuilding the APK does not add
missing routes to a deployed backend.

## Vercel

1. Open the existing Vercel project serving `abc-self-psi.vercel.app`.
2. Verify its Git repository and production branch contain the current backend.
3. Set **Root Directory** to `Backend` when deploying this repository. Use the
   **Express** framework preset and its default build settings.
4. Ensure the existing production `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set.
5. Deploy the latest source to production. Redeploying an older deployment
   rebuilds that older source and will still omit the announcement routes.

Alternatively, deploy the local backend with the Vercel CLI from PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath (Join-Path (git rev-parse --show-toplevel).Trim() 'Backend')
npx vercel@latest login
npx vercel@latest link
# Select the existing project serving abc-self-psi.vercel.app.
npx vercel@latest --prod
```

`index.js` exports the complete Express application, following
[Vercel's Express deployment support](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/express).
Vercel imports it without starting a local listener or running the database seed
job. `npm start` and `npm run dev` still start the local server and initialize
the database. Notification routes create their tables on first use.

After deployment, verify the hosted endpoints:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod 'https://abc-self-psi.vercel.app/api/health'
Invoke-RestMethod 'https://abc-self-psi.vercel.app/api/notifications'
Invoke-RestMethod 'https://abc-self-psi.vercel.app/api/notifications/unread-count'
```

The notifications list should return `success: true` and a `data` array. Then
post an announcement from the admin screen and check the student announcements
tab. The APK already uses the correct URL, so this backend deployment does not
require an APK rebuild.
